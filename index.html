    <p1>Professional Statment<br>
        

Jason Lashbrook is a truck driver and marine veteran and his strongest subjects in school were math and science. He enjoys learning and excelled in school combat training and productivity as a truck driver.  He likes creating spreadsheets to organize everyday tasks at school.  He also likes analyzing complex tasks and implement training exercises whenever possible.  Jason has a passion for technology and enjoys helping others. He is interested in the field of security but has no previous experience in that field. He wants an entry-level cybersecurity position that will utilize his drive and thirst for knowledge. He believes the Google Cybersecurity Certificate is a stepping stone and will make him be a better candidate to help him develop the professional skills he lacks for this position.
